Hello! My name is Maggie.
I am a big fan of vintage web design, free and open source software, and Linux, and I'm enthusiastic about NLP.
I'm pretty new to coding all things considered, and I'm working on brushing up on my web design skills. Currently, I'm making my way through the freeCodeCamp curriculum, supplemented with other excercises.
I'm looking to collaborate on projects that involve language processing, as well as anything that will give me opportunities to learn and grow.
Feel free to reach out to me at slf66@pitt.edu!
